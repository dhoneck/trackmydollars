  <h3>What is an expense fund?</h3>
  <p>An expense fund is an allocation of money to cover future expenses. You can create a separate savings account and
      deposit money into it every month and withdraw from it when those expenses are due. The purpose of this is to make
      our budgets more consistent and easier to stick to. Things that we would put in our expense fund are expenses that
      are not normal monthly expenses such as birthdays, holidays, annual subscription renewals, quarterly bills, etc.
